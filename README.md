Was taking a short test on HackerRank and the task was to filter given set of DNA strands by the following conditions:
- strand has to be longer than 10 characters
- strand has to be shorter than 100 characters
- should only contain capital letters
- strand should only consist of A, C, T, G letters
- if the resulting list has less than 3 elements, than return an empty string.

Part 2 required to sequence each strand in the filtered sequence by matching the last and the first three letters
of each strand, then joining such matching strands and removing the overlapping endings. 

Part 3 required to match every three elements to an aminoacid, and the dictionary was supposed to be provided by 
a variable inside the code. I will skip this part as I don't have such vocabulary.
